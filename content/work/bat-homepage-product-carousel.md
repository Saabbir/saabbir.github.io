# Background

## Evidence

BAT would like to experiment with introducing a product carousel onto the homepage below the hero banner, which enables users to add products to basket without the need to navigate to PLP/PDP. The main use case for this functionality is the Mix & Match offer on flavours.

## Hypothesis

By introducing a product carousel on the homepage, we expect to see an uplift in sales for the featured products, and therefore an overall uplift in total transactions.
