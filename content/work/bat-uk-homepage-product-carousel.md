## The Problem

The current website structure presents a discoverability challenge for users seeking best-selling products. While most traffic lands on the homepage, finding these products requires an additional step of navigating to a dedicated "collection" page. This extra step can lead to user frustration and abandonment, as some visitors may not be willing to invest the additional effort.

## The Solution

To address the discoverability challenge and improve user experience, we implemented a strategic product carousel on the homepage. This carousel showcases a curated selection of best-selling products, allowing users to browse and interact with these high-performing items directly from the landing page.

## The Results

The final winning design resulted in:

- 35% increase in add to basket
- 12.3% uplift in product page views
- 18% increase in checkout page visits
- 11.6% increase in transactions
- 5.2% increase in average order value
